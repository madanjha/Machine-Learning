To split the dataset into training and testing data, if we use the following
code. X = data[‘YearsExperience’]
y = data[‘Salary’]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2,
random_state=0) What does it mean when we write the test size as 0.2?

Marked Answer :
The training data will consist of 80% of the samples from the total population.
